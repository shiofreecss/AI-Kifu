# Sound Files for AI-Kifu

## Stone Sound

You need to add a sound file named `stone-sound.mp3` to this directory to enable the stone placement sound feature.

### Recommendations:

1. You can find free Go stone sound effects on websites like Freesound.org or similar sound effect libraries.
2. The sound should be short (around 0.5-1 second) and crisp.
3. Ideal sounds are those that mimic the click of a stone being placed on a wooden Go board.
4. Save the file as `stone-sound.mp3` in this directory.

### Example sources:
- Freesound.org: https://freesound.org/search/?q=go+stone
- Free Sound Effects websites
- Public domain sound libraries

Once you've added the sound file, the "Enable Sound" toggle in the application will work properly.
