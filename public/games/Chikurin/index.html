<h1>Chikurin Cup</h1>
The Chikurin Cup was a tournament that has been played three times,
in 1999, 2000 and 2001. The first two times the 8 players were
young (at most 24) and promising. The third time there were
4 veteran players and 4 young players.
<p>
The name Chikurin Cup (竹林杯) was derived from the kanji in the
names of Otake (大竹) Hideo and Rin (林) Kaiho. These two players
were the organizers of the tournament, and commented the games
in the sponsoring Japanese journals Go Club (囲碁クラブ, 1999 only)
and Go World (碁ワールド).
