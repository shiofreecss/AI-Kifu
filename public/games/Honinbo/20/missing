There are two games Yamabe Toshiro vs Fujisawa Shuko both won by Yamabe,
one dated 1964-12-23, the League game,
and one dated 1965-04-07,08, the Playoff.
I have only one. The game here called C01.sgf may be the League game.
(Our choice was made because just like C01.sgf, the Playoff game only
took a single day.)

missing:
1964-12-23,24 Yamabe Toshiro B+R Fujisawa Shuko
