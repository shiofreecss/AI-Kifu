<h1>5th Honinbo preliminaries</h1>
<h2>1st Preliminary (5-dans)</h2>
Participants were the 5-dans. (Some got promoted during this preliminary.)
Three rounds were played.
After two rounds the scores were Takahashi Shigeyuki 2-0, Kajiwara Takeo 1-1,
Mukai Kazuo 1-1, Nakamura Yutaro 1-1, Koizumi Shigeo 1-1, Nakagawa Arata 1-1,
Miwa Yoshiro 0-2. In the end, Takahashi continued to the 6/7-dan Preliminary.

<h2>2nd Preliminary (6/7-dans)</h2>
Fourteen players played in three rounds.
Participants were the 6/7-dans, and Takahashi Shigeyuki. (And what about Suzuki?)
Mitsuhara, Sakai, Fukuda and Murashima dropped out after losing
in both Round 1 and Round 2. Takagawa did beat Hasegawa in Round 1, and
Hasegawa did beat Shinohara in Round 3. Most further results seem to be unknown.

<p>
Hasegawa, Hayashi, Takagawa and Suzuki went on to participate in the League.

<font size="-2">(Shimamura did not, so probably he lost his third game.
His two wins did not suffice, but Suzuki continued, hence probably won three times.)</font>
