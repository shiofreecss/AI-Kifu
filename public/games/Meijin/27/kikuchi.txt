Sole surviving amateur wins in Meijin tournament
  To commemorate the 40th year of the Amateur Best Ten tournament, the Asahi Newspaper invited the top five place-getters to play in the first preliminary round of the 27th Meijin tournament. That means, in theory, that an amateur could become Meijin if he kept winning.

  Four of the amateurs have already been eliminated, but the 71-year-old Kikuchi Yasuro is still fighting on. In his first game, played last year, Kikuchi beat one of his disciples at the Ryukusei Gakuen, Osawa Narumi 2-dan. In the second, played on the 17th, Kikuchi (B) defeated Nakazawa Ayako 4-dan by resignation and so reached the final of his section of the first preliminary round. One more win and he will go into the second preliminary round. To reach the league, he would probably have to win a total of nine games in a row. That would certainly stir up some interest.
