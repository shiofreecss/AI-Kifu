<h1>IBM Hayago Open</h1>
The IBM Hayago Open (IBM早碁オープン戦, Hayago = Rapid go, Lightning go)
was a Japanese international tournament, held from 1988 to 1990.
It was "open" because participation was open to amateurs,
but none got past the preliminaries.
It was "international" because each year there were
two players from China, and two from Korea.
It was "lightning" because the time allotted was
60 min each followed by 30-second byo-yomi.
Komi was 5.5.
<p>
<blockquote><font size="-2">
In fact the reports about the time allowance are contradictory.
For the first year, all reports seem to say 1h for each player.
For the third year, most sources have 30m.
For the 2nd year, three Nihon Ki-in game records that I have say 1h.
But Go World 56 and 59 list 30m for the final and the Redmond vs. Ishida Y.
games. And Ranka 1990 (p. 72) says that
<i>In June 1989, Joseph Wang was paired against a Japanese 2p pro and won.
This victory, though obtained under rather pressured circumstances
(45 minutes per player) marks the first time that a US amateur
has beaten a professional in formal international competition.</i></font>
<!-- Possibly it was 45m for the preliminaries,
and 1h for the main tournament. -->

In the third round, played at the Nihon Ki-in on 4 September,
Yu 3-dan of Korea defeated Takemiya. Yu was then
eliminated by Otake in the quarter-finals (the
fourth round), played on the same day, so that
meant that all the overseas players had been
