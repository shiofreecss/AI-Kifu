Japanese Fujitsu Cup Representatives

Two of Japan's five non-seeded places in the 13th Fujitsu Cup were
decided on 17 January. One went to Cho U 6-dan, a 20-year-old
Taiwanese-born member of the Tokyo Nihon Ki-in. The other place went
to Hikosaka Naoto 9-dan, who will be making his second appearance in
the Fujitsu Cup. The pairings in the playoffs for the other three
places are interesting. They are: Kobayashi Koichi vs. Takemiya
Masaki, Moriyama Naoki vs. Takao Shinji, and O Rissei vs. Michael
Redmond.
