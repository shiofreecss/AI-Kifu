and Yasui Sanchi II for the post of Meijin Godokoro.
It was to be a match over 60 games, but only 20 games were played.
In the first 16, Doetsu played on josen (B in each game), and the
score was 9-3 for Doetsu, with 4 jigos.
In the last 4, Doetsu played on sen-ai-sen (B two out of three games),
and the score was 3-1 for Doetsu (B won in each game).
In 1676 Yasui Sanchi gave up the office of Meijin Godokoro.
