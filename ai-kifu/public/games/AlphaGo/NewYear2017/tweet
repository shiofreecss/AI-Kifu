From Demis Hassabis, 04/01/17:
“We’ve been hard at work improving AlphaGo, and over the past few days
we’ve played some unofficial online games at fast time controls with
our new prototype version, to check that it’s working as well as we
hoped. We thank everyone who played our accounts Magister(P) and
Master(P) on the Tygem and FoxGo servers, and everyone who enjoyed
watching the games too! We’re excited by the results and also by what
we and the Go community can learn from some of the innovative and
successful moves played by the new version of AlphaGo.”
