感謝大家對AlphaGo最近的測試對局所展現出的興趣，我們團隊感到很高興。由於這60局棋被廣泛且深入的研究，我們想要澄清兩處人為的操作失誤，幫助大家更好的分析這些對局。這些是由於快棋而導致的人為操作失誤，因此沒有下出AlphaGo原本的下法。

The AlphaGo team has been delighted by the Go community's interest in AlphaGo's recent test games played by Master(P) and Magister(P). As these 60 games have become the object of deep study and investigation, we would like to clarify two situations in which, due to the short time controls, the operator accidentally entered a move other than AlphaGo's recommendation. We hope these notes will help all the Go players analyzing and learning from these games.

在第9局與HopeIdo(P)的對局中，AlphaGo原本是想下在圖中的黑1(F13)提子，實戰的K6是操作者的失誤。

In game 9 against HopeIdo(P), AlphaGo recommended capturing at F13, and K6 was an operator error.

在與jpgo01的對局中，AlphaGo原本是想下在圖中的黑1(O12)，實戰的N6是人為失誤。

In the game against jpgo01, AlphaGo suggested O12 instead of N6, which was also due to human error.

大橋拓文[Ohashi Hirofumi 6p]: I thought K6 is strange in game 9. On the other hand, N6 was good move, but it looks better O12 now with jpgo01. Was N6 a second or third suggestion by AlphaGo??
Aja Huang: No, N6 was simply a mis-click.
